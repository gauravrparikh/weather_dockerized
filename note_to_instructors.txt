Dear TA/ Professor,

I am hoping to take this class to really learn both the content as well as "best practices". 
My real hope is that at the end of this class, I can build a cross platform app that I can actually put on the app store and play store.

I have been doing a lot of things sloppily in the past due to lack of good training, 
proper guidance or meaningful code reviews. 

I request you whenever possible to also give me stylistic guidance/ i.e. whether a certain design choice makes sense or not etc.

In this assignment, I tried to properly learn how to "build" using Docker and creating an environment file, in addition to the requirements. 

Thanks a lot in advance. 
Best,
Gaurav.
